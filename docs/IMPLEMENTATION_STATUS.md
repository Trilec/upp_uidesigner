# UiDesigner implementation status

## Supervisor source status

The greenfield UiDesigner source implementation is complete on the supervisor branch and is ready for the Windows/U++ validation pass.

Implemented systems include:

- authored three-pill Designer and two-region Theme Studio shell;
- canonical document/session separation;
- typed command transactions, undo/redo and dirty tracking;
- catalog-driven properties, events, capabilities and adapter identifiers;
- semantic Spacer, layout break and separator support without a dummy runtime `Ctrl`;
- legacy Spacer migration into an implicit compatible layout;
- stable preview controls and semantic layout-item projection;
- searchable flat toolbox categories;
- catalog, hierarchy and canvas drag/drop through a pure drop planner;
- terminal-only atomic insertion/reparenting and one undo entry per drop;
- PropertyEditor preview/commit/reset and mixed multi-selection;
- separate Theme document, preview and history;
- typed behavior/action bindings and Behavior Inspector;
- built-in Close, Accept, Cancel, Exit, property, page and named-handler actions;
- generated/user-owned C++ separation;
- registered child-attachment adapters for layouts, page containers and splitters;
- deterministic semantic Spacer and behavior code generation;
- complete package, component, project JSON, document JSON and Theme JSON exports;
- recoverable multi-file export publication and user-code preservation;
- CLI and MCP coverage for catalog, document, drops, behavior, Theme and export;
- original UiDesigner tests plus focused FoundationTests;
- generated-package build/process smoke automation;
- architecture, drag/drop, behavior and export contracts.

## Previous validated baseline

Before this final feature pass, the integrated baseline had:

- architecture guard passing;
- PropertyEditor: 47 checks, 0 failures;
- UiDesigner: 100 checks, 0 failures;
- CLI list/schema smoke passing;
- MCP newline and Content-Length framing passing;
- UiDesigner, CLI and MCP compiling under CLANGx64.

Those results do not prove the later supervisor branch. They are the starting baseline only.

## Pending external proof

The final branch still requires the real Windows host to run `RunSupervisorValidation.ps1` and an interactive desktop audit. Until that happens, the following must not be described as verified:

- final CLANGx64 compilation of every changed package;
- FoundationTests result count;
- generated fixture compilation through `umk`;
- final CLI/MCP smokes;
- visible top-level window and native handle;
- exact visual comparison with Curt's Designer and Theme exports;
- catalog/hierarchy/canvas drag cycles;
- Spacer visual selection and separator rendering;
- Behavior Inspector interaction;
- export-dialog selection, overwrite and preservation workflows;
- lifecycle and stress results.

## Design decisions

- The toolbox is a searchable flat catalog; the hierarchy remains a tree.
- Spacer is semantic layout data, not a fake control.
- Drag hover is transient and never mutates the document.
- Behavior bindings are declarative and transport-neutral; custom code lives in named user-owned handlers.
- `.generated.*` files are replaceable; user `.h/.cpp` files are preserved.
- Application version is `v1.0.1-RC1` for the current release-candidate validation pass.

## Validation entry point

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File RunSupervisorValidation.ps1
```

After that automated sequence passes, perform the interactive audit described in the supervisor handoff task.


## Preset and persistence contract

- Load owns whole-document starters: Blank form, Three-pane form and Dialog form.
- Presets are composable command-backed fragments and can be inserted into compatible selected hosts.
- The current project format remains the canonical wrapper because it stores document and theme together; document schema 4 makes explicit child arrays authoritative.
- Legacy imports validate and restore explicit per-parent child order rather than relying on flat node-array order.
